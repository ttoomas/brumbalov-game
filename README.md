# BRUMBÁLOV (DUMBLEDORE) GAME

## Status: All game modes working 
## Important news: Open the game only on good pc, otherwise it will explode (too large 3d models (20mb)) -> The slower is your pc, the slower is the game and its harder to win. I recommend 60fps+ for the most satisfaction, otherwise the animations will be laggy.
